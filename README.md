## Navigation
- [**LendGuard**](https://github.com/Lend-Guard/LendGuard) - Contains the core contracts powering LendGuard's functionalities.
- [**LendGuardOracle**](https://github.com/Lend-Guard/LendGuardOracle) - he keeper module responsible for monitoring guards. Users can fork it and customize it for their specific keeper implementation in the Guard's contract.
- [**LendGuardDApp**](https://github.com/Lend-Guard/LendGuardDapp) - Backend and frontend components for the LendGuard application.

## Key concepts
- Target Health Factor - The Target Health Factor (THF) signifies the health factor within a lending protocol, serving as the base for all threshold calculations. For example, if you set `THF=1.5` and configure a notification alert at 10%, the alert will trigger at `1.1 * 1.5` = 1.65 HF.
- Guard - A Guard refers to the specific contract configured and deployed by a user. It plays a pivotal role in managing positions and executing keeper-related actions.
- Keeper/Oracle - The Keeper or Oracle is an off-chain program responsible for monitoring Guards and executing pre-approved deposits or repayments for selected tokens.
- Push Notification - LendGuard utilizes the [Push Protocol's](https://app.push.org/) notification system, which the Keeper employs to send alerts and notifications to users.
